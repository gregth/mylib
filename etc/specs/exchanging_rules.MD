Users can press "I want it!" button on any of the book copies, if they want to get the book copy

*A notification is beeing sent to the user who has made the book avaialble. The user who wants and the user who gives the book come in contact through the messages platform.

*Then user who gives the book can accept the request or reject it ( justifying the reason of rejection ).

*Once the request is accepted, the book receiver has to confirm that the book was received, proving that the transaction was succesfull.
