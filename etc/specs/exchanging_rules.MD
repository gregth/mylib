#Rules for book exchanging

The automated system should ensure that users follow the rules mentioned below:

* Every user can get ONLY ONE book per week. 
* If the difference ***"number of books the user has taken - number of books the user has given"*** is larger than two, user has to add a book copy. If user doesn't do so, he can't procceed to any exchanges.
